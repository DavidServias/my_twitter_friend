# my_twitter_friend
A twitter bot that followers all of its followers, and likes all of its followers tweets. 
You can follow this bot @yourFriend_Tim

# History:
This started out as a parody twitter account pretending to be a very annoying know-it-all music student 
(Trombone Tim). Later the character transformed into an aspiring brain surgeon who decided that medical
school was too expensive, and it would be better to learn the art and science of brain surgery on his 
own by watching youtube videos and practicing in his grandmother's basement (Brain Surgeon Tim). 

After a while, this got boring, so I decided to turn the account into a bot. You might be able to 
look back and see tweets from the accounts previous identities, but I'm not sure how far twitter lets you
go back.

# Purpose:
Sometimes I see people write Tweets that just sit there, all alone, and it seems kind of sad. I have written
a few of those myself. If you follow this bot, it will follow you back, and like all of your tweets, so
you never have to feel is if you're being ignored. Everybody needs a twitter friend like this.
